# Participation at SRCCON:LEAD

At SRCCON:LEAD, everyone participates in some way. Our [hands-on sessions](/sessions) rely on participants who are ready to share their experiences and perspectives. [Facilitators create space](/program) for in-depth conversations, design exercises, demos, and workshops, and participants bring questions and take ideas back to their newsrooms. In addition to sessions, folks help make SRCCON:LEAD an inclusive, welcoming place by leading group activities, volunteering, and even just saying hi to new friends and collaborators over meals and coffee/tea/hot beverages.

## Inviting participants and allocating tickets

SRCCON:LEAD is intentionally small, with about 125 participants. This size means we were intentional about equitably distributing tickets and ensuring that there will be a mix of perspectives and skills at SRCCON:LEAD. Our call for participation form helped us understand who wanted to take part and what they wanted to get out of this event. With those responses, we've worked to create a schedule and audience that reflects the dynamic interests and needs of this community.

Our call for participation is now closed.

## Details about ticket prices

This year [we began experimenting with a tiered ticket pricing system](https://opennews.org/blog/srccon-2019-launch). Accessibility remains a core value for us, and this is our attempt to balance the actual costs of our events with keeping prices as manageable for attendees as possible. We also continue to offer [scholarships to attend](/scholarships).

Here are the tiers for tickets to SRCCON:LEAD (plus Eventbrite ticketing fees):

* **$225:** This was our ticket price last year and remains the base price for people who are paying their own way, from small news organizations with fewer than 50 people, or nonprofits with budgets $750,000 or less.
* **$375:** This tier is for people from medium-sized news organizations of 51-250 employees, nonprofits with budgets $750,000-$2 million, and other similar-sized organizations.
* **$695:** This ticket tier reflects very nearly the actual cost for each attendee of SRCCON:LEAD and is for people from large news organizations with more than 250 employees, nonprofits with budgets over $2 million, and other organizations that provide full professional-development budgets for employees.

Here's the most important thing to know about these ticket prices: _We want you to choose the one that makes sure you can be at SRCCON:LEAD_. We don't review who pays what, and we won't follow up with any questions. If you work for an organization where budgets have already been set or there's not additional travel support available to you, _choose a lower price_ and join us in Philly.

We based these tiers on community feedback encouraging us to find ways to share event costs. At SRCCON 2019, they were a huge part of what made it possible to organize an event with scholarships, free childcare, live transcription, two lunches, dinner, and ample snacks and drinks, and the support of a skilled event team in preparing sessions and constructing a schedule that lets attendees focus on learning and talking together.

If you have any questions at all about ticket pricing, [please reach out](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Facilitating sessions

At SRCCON events, session facilitators regularly make up more than a third of attendees. All of our sessions [are peer-led by conference attendees](/program).

## Welcome, first-timers

We think SRCCON events are best when there's a mix of new folks and veterans. And we want new folks to feel able to participate in whatever ways interest you. There's a spot on [the form](/participation/form) to ask for more information if you're interested in attending but not quite sure how you want to participate. In reviewing forms, we'll aim to have a healthy mix of newcomers and returning SRCCON participants. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot.

## Financial & family assistance

We have a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) available to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. The deadline to apply for a SRCCON:LEAD scholarship has passed, but travel support will be part of future SRCCON events too.

In addition to financial assistance for travel, we know that you may have childcare or caretaking responsibilities that affect your ability to participate in events like this. We'll have more details about the [childcare and caretaking support](/childcare) we can offer soon, and there's also a question on the form to let us know you'd like all the info about that support.
