Everyone at SRCCON:LEAD contributes to making it happen. Our call for participation form is now open with questions about attending, pitching a session, and applying for a scholarship.

# Participation at SRCCON:LEAD

SRCCON:LEAD is a hands-on conference, which means that everyone who attends actively participates throughout the event. We [are excited to hear about](/participation/form) what ideas you'd like to bring into this event, and what you hope to take back home with you. 

## Not just attendees, but participants

At SRCCON:LEAD, everyone participates in some way. [Our hands-on sessions rely on participants](/sessions/about) who are ready to share their experiences and perspectives. [Facilitators create space](/sessions/about#facilitators) for in-depth conversations, design exercises, demos, and workshops, and participants bring questions and take ideas back to their newsrooms. In addition to sessions, folks help make SRCCON:LEAD an inclusive, welcoming place by leading group activities, volunteering, and even just saying hi to new friends and collaborators over meals and coffee/tea/hot beverages.

## Inviting participants and allocating tickets

We keep the size of SRCCON:LEAD intentionally small, at about 125 participants. This size means we need to be intentional about equitably distributing tickets and ensuring that there are a mix of perspectives and skills at SRCCON:LEAD. Our call for participation form will help us understand who would like to take part and what you want to get out of it. With those responses, we'll work to create a schedule and audience that reflects the dynamic interests and needs of this community.

The deadline for session proposals and scholarship applications has passed, and we'll keep [the participation form](/participation/form/) open for attendees as long as we can. If invited to attend, you will have the chance to purchase a ticket starting at $225 plus fees.

## Facilitating sessions

At SRCCON events, session facilitators regularly make up more than a third of attendees. All of our sessions [are peer-led by conference attendees](/program).

## Welcome, first-timers

We think SRCCON events are best when there's a mix of new folks and veterans. And we want new folks to feel able to participate in whatever ways interest you. There's a spot on [the form](/participation/form) to ask for more information if you're interested in attending but not quite sure how you want to participate. In reviewing forms, we'll aim to have a healthy mix of newcomers and returning SRCCON participants. So SRCCON alums, you can put your name in without worrying that you're taking a new attendee's spot.

## Financial & family assistance

We have a limited number of [travel scholarships](/scholarships) available to help people who wouldn't otherwise be able to attend. The deadline to apply for a SRCCON:LEAD scholarship has passed, but travel support will be part of future SRCCON events too.

In addition to financial assistance for travel, we know that you may have childcare or caretaking responsibilities that affect your ability to participate in events like this. We'll have more details about the [childcare and caretaking support](/childcare) we can offer soon, and there's also a question on the form to let us know you'd like all the info about that support.
