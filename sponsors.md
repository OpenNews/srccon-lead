# Sponsor SRCCON:LEAD

SRCCON:LEAD is a small conference with a program that digs deeply into how leadership operates at the intersection of journalism and technology. It builds on the collaborative, peer-driven conference <a href="https://srccon.org">SRCCON</a>, where over five years we have brought hundreds of members of the news-code community together for hands-on sessions exploring the cultural and technical ideas that push journalism forward. Our events attract the best newsroom developers, designers, and data analysts for two days of thinking, working, and building together.

_"You all are leading the way on how to have a great conference that is welcoming for everyone, and someday the tech industry will be so much better off when it adopts what you've done."_ 

_"This was the first conference I've been a part of where I felt I belonged on every level."_ 

SRCCON is a journalism conference people love. This reaction comes from the approach SRCCON takes: highly participatory and extraordinarily inclusive. We're grateful for the support of sponsors in helping make this event possible.

We offer several levels of sponsorship in order to accommodate a variety of sizes of companies and organizations. Below you&rsquo;ll see some of our recent offerings. These may evolve as we plan for this unique event, but this will give you an idea of the type of sponsorships we may offer. <a href="mailto:erika@opennews.org">Email us</a> to talk about options!

## Why sponsor SRCCON

For journalism-technologists, newsroom leaders (both formal and informal), and others seeking to change journalism for the better, SRCCON is where they can sit down away from the deadlines and the day-to-day and learn from each other. We want you to help make that happen.

Sponsors help us make this event unique and accessible by keeping our ticket price well below cost, getting people to the event, and bringing in the special touches that make SRCCON… SRCCON. As one attendee put it, “The structure of the program and the attention to detail and people's needs is what makes this an exceptional and special event.” Sponsors are what make the detail, intentional design, and accessibility all possible.

_“SRCCON is the best conference I go to all year. It's so thoughtful and well planned. I feel happy, safe, and informed.”_ (all quotations from SRCCON attendees in post-event surveys)
