    <p>Working together with publishers around the world through trainings, programs, and partnerships, the Facebook Journalism Project seeks to help strengthen communities by connecting people with meaningful journalism. We create strong ties with the news industry through 3 efforts. First, we build community through news, working and investing in institutes dedicated to funding high-quality journalism and building sustainable futures for community-based news. Second, we train newsrooms globally—visiting newsrooms and offering online courses to train journalists around the world on how to leverage social tools to tell stories that matter. Third, we support quality through journalism by partnering directly with news publishers and non-profit organizations to combat misinformation, promote news literacy, fund news initiatives, share best practices, and improve journalism on our platform.

    <p>The Lenfest Institute for Journalism is the first-of-its-kind non-profit organization whose sole mission is to develop and support sustainable business models for great local journalism. The Institute was founded in 2016 by cable television entrepreneur H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest. Lenfest gifted to the Institute an initial endowment of $20 million, which has since been supplemented by other donors, for investment in high-impact journalism; news technology and innovation; and diverse, growing audiences. Lenfest also gifted his ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer to the Institute, and these news properties now serve as a live lab for the its innovation efforts.</p>
