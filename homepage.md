## About SRCCON:LEAD

SRCCON:LEAD is the third in a series of smaller, thematic events built around the hands-on problem-solving that the news-nerd community brings into [SRCCON](https://srccon.org) events. [SRCCON:WORK](https://work.srccon.org/) explored how we support each other and collaborate. [SRCCON:POWER](https://power.srccon.org/) dug into the power dynamics of newsroom relationships and decisionmaking.

Those themes carry us into SRCCON:LEAD, where we'll:

* wrestle with the ways this industry often doesn't prepare or support the people it asks to lead
* imagine better, more inclusive ways to wield and understand power
* inspire each other to transform how leadership works in our own organizations, regardless of title or job description
* teach each other the practical skills—from handling money and hiring to effective communication—we can use to be part of that change

This is a conference for people with leadership experience, people who aren't in leadership but want to be, and for people who don't want to be but know journalism leadership needs to be better. We believe we learn best when we learn from each other, and coming together for hard conversations can strengthen our community.

Our program has collaboration at its heart, with sessions proposed and led by community members, and a schedule built to support them. We also believe that people who work in journalism-tech are uniquely positioned to lead, because they already work across teams, disciplines, and organizations.
