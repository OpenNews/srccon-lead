SRCCON:LEAD will reimagine how journalism leadership operates because we know it _has to change_. Through talks, hands-on sessions, and emergent conversations, 125 participants will spend two days developing the skills to build more inclusive, representative news organizations—from within or from the ground up.

Our [call for participation](/participation/form) is open through Monday, October 7. Join us!

## When & Where

November 19 & 20 in Philadelphia, at the [Fleisher Art Memorial](https://fleisher.org/)

## About SRCCON:LEAD

SRCCON:LEAD is the third in a series of smaller, thematic events built around the hands-on problem-solving that the news-nerd community brings into [SRCCON](https://srccon.org) events. [SRCCON:WORK](https://work.srccon.org/) explored how we support each other and collaborate. [SRCCON:POWER](https://work.srccon.org/) dug into the dynamics of newsroom relationships, and how power influences decisionmaking in journalism.

Those themes carry us into SRCCON:LEAD, where we'll:

* wrestle with the ways this industry often doesn't prepare or support the people it asks to lead
* confront newsroom fears of discussing money, conflict, and diversity and inclusion
* inspire each other to transform our own organizations, regardless of title or job description
* teach each other the practical skills—from strategic planning to effective communication—we can use to be part of that change

This is a conference for people with leadership experience, people who aren't in leadership but want to be, and for people who don't want to be but know journalism leadership needs to be better. We believe we learn best when we learn from each other, and coming together for hard conversations can strengthen our community.

Our program has collaboration at its heart, with sessions proposed and led by community members, and a schedule built to support them. We also believe that people who work in journalism-tech are uniquely positioned to lead, because they already work across teams, disciplines, and organizations.

## Who participates and how?

We'll gather 125 people who want to reimagine leadership in journalism. Sometimes that work comes with a title, sometimes it comes with pay—we also know it oftentimes comes with neither.

SRCCON events work because they bring together different backgrounds and types of experience, so we're inviting people who:

* are leading from within their organizations, in formal ways or through roles they weren't hired for. Mentoring peers, elevating equity and inclusion, organizing for better salaries, exploring new products and revenue models, repairing relationships with communities—this is all leadership work that's changing journalism from the inside.
* manage teams, big or small, from well-established to just starting up. People who see hiring as a chance to develop a team that reflects the places they cover. People who are figuring things out on the fly, but see honest conversations, well-handled conflict, and even a few internal spreadsheets as tools to transform how journalism works. And people who think someday, they might want to move into a role like that too.

If you're reading this, we bet you'll see echoes of your own work here. The conversations at SRCCON:LEAD need your insights, gathered through work experience, life experience, or otherwise. This event is built in a way that helps people from many styles and levels of leadership listen to and learn from each other. Whether you've attended before, have never been, or have never even heard of SRCCON, we're excited for _you_ to participate!
