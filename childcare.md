# Childcare and caretaking

We know that you may have childcare or caretaking responsibilities that affect your ability to participate in events like this. We want to help make it possible for you to attend, and we're exploring ways to do that based on the needs of attendees, whether that be offering free childcare at a nearby hotel, recommending nearby drop-off daycare providers, or stipends for caregiving coverage in Philly or back at home.

We have a question on the call for participation form to tell us about your caregiving needs. Please feel free to [email us to discuss any options](srccon@opennews.org) or ask any questions as well.
