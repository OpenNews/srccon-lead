# Scholarships

We don't want cost to prevent you from coming to SRCCON:LEAD, which is why we work to keep ticket prices low. To help defray the cost of attending, OpenNews also offers a limited number of travel scholarships. Whether you're a newsroom developer at a small organization with a strained professional development budget or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we want to help you attend.

The deadline to apply for a SRCCON:LEAD scholarship has passed, but travel support will be part of future SRCCON events too.

## What we offer

A ticket to SRCCON:LEAD and $500 for you to use toward the cost of travel to the event. (For scholarship recipients who live in the Philadelphia area, we offer a SRCCON:LEAD ticket without the additional travel funding.)

## Who should apply

* Anyone who is part of the journalism code community
* Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism code community
* People of color, women, and other underrepresented groups in technology are strongly encouraged to apply

## How to apply

The deadline to apply for a SRCCON:LEAD scholarship has passed, but travel support will be part of future SRCCON events too.

## When notifications go out

Notifications for scholarships will go out alongisde other notifications as part of the call for participation. Everyone who filled out the call for participation form by October 7 will hear back from us by October 14.

## What happens after SRCCON:LEAD

You tell us how it went! We'll send you a short followup survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation at SRCCON:LEAD.

## Why are you offering this scholarship?

We want to make sure that SRCCON:LEAD is an event that includes the diversity of the communities we serveâ€”geographically, demographically, experientially, and more. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that.

## How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?

OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and from smaller and non-coastal newsrooms.

## Do I still need to purchase a ticket to SRCCON:LEAD?

If you receive a scholarship, you will not have to purchase a ticket.

## When will I receive my scholarship?

When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to fill out a form and send some tax paperwork for our administrators to process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.

## What if I need more than $500 for my travel?

We're able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Luckily, Philadelphia is a relatively cheap city once you arrive. Also, this entire site runs [off a Github repo](https://github.com/OpenNews/srccon-power), so if you say, wanted to add a link to a room-share board, you could go right ahead and do that. Or, you can [email with any suggestions](mailto:erika@opennews.org).
