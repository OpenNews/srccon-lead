We will start with a quick survey of recent diversity reports published by prominent journalism outlets and then move to a discussion/group activity to work out what measures should be included in diversity reports to further the actual goals of increasing diversity in newsrooms.",

But what if there is no one model we can depend on? We believe that the most important thing leaders can do is to better understand both their particular skills at leadership and the nature of the relationships they need to manage: with their team, their stakeholders, the work, and themselves. In this session, we will investigate leadership through this lens, rather than through the assumptions we have been conditioned to form around hierarchical management and the traditional tasks assigned to the role. We will discuss the role of power balance in leadership and how to shift that balance as your team’s needs and challenges change. You will walk away with a better and more flexible sense of how you lead and better tools for making decisions that feel both effective and natural to you.",

If we want to truly represent the people we serve, meet their information needs, and have them see value in our journalism, we must consider how our own structures, processes, and policies affect our ability to do so. Ultimately, we need to build cultures of resilience that take an inclusive approach, strengthening our organizations’ ability to prioritize listening and learning and expand opportunities for shared decision-making across our staff and into our communities. \n\nThis session will use tools and concepts from systems thinking and resilience theory to explore how newsrooms can build more inclusive, participatory processes internally. We'll discuss questions such as:\n- What does a resilient news organization look like?\n- How can we redistribute power and decision-making to create more equitable newsrooms for all staff and the communities they serve?\n- In what ways can we increase participation – both inside and outside of the newsroom?\n- How are we being intentional about how we’ve designed our organizations in ways that strengthen networks over hierarchy?\n\nTogether, we’ll identify concrete opportunities for change that participants can use to strengthen their newsrooms’ internal resilience and overall sustainability.",

Maybe they rushed through the appointment, barely made eye contact, or didn’t respond in a way that made you feel like your urgency or concern was acknowledged or considered. Narrative medicine seeks to bridge these gaps in caregiver/patient communication through narrative, storytelling, and creative writing training for medical professionals. As of 10 years ago, this practice was considered experimental. Now, medical schools and institutions around the country are incorporating this cross-disciplinary approach into their core programs.\n\nIn journalism, some of the same imbalances in power and communication are furthering the divide among journalism institutions, journalists, subjects and the audience. How can journalism leadership look to other areas or disciplines to create a more equitable and ethical practice moving into the future?\n\nIt’s not just narrative medicine we can learn from. What does cultural repatriation teach us about ownership of a community’s story? What can we learn from reconciliation, the just transition framework, restorative practices, remedial education and community organizing to inform our leadership? There is much from beyond the realm of traditional journalism that we can turn to in order to learn how to be more inclusive, equitable, considerate and creative as leaders and practitioners. Bring your whole self, your life, your experiences and your curiosity and join us for a frank group discussion and brainstorming session around different fields of practice, approaches, skills and styles that we can practice to be better leaders.",

We all know this as it relates to code-based projects. We have tools and processes available for version control, tracking changes, and writing reproducible, documented files. But when it comes to the day-to-day strategy decisions that drive the content and impact of our journalism, we don’t take the same consistently documented approach. This scattered project management means that it is harder to support our decisions, to transfer institutional knowledge, to get large teams aligned, and it is harder to spot signs of problematic approaches.\n\nTogether we will explore what information would be useful to record, how to track and share decisions within and across our teams, and how to get support for documented decision-making.",
