## Venue

SRCCON:LEAD will take place at the [Fleisher Art Memorial](https://fleisher.org), an art school and event space in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Philadelphia.

## Schedule

**Dates:** November 19 & 20

[Check out the SRCCON:LEAD schedule](/schedule) for our full conference program. The entirety of SRCCON:LEAD is covered by our [code of conduct](/conduct) and we've got a [support plan](/support) to back you up, too.

## Hotel

The Fleisher Art Memorial is in a residential neighborhood without large hotels nearby. We booked a discounted hotel block about a mile from the venue. There are several other large, chain hotels a similar distance from the venue, with some smaller hotels and bed and breakfasts closer to the venue as well.

You can [use this link to book at the Cambria Hotel](https://www.choicehotels.com/reservations/groups/ef61n6?source=EMCHGGI&appl_group=EMCHGGI), where we have a discount block, as long as space remains available. The nightly rate will be $190 plus taxes.

## Getting around Philly

If you're coming to Philly on Amtrak, you'll get off at 30th Street Station. The Amtrak station is a half-block away from the Market-Frankford subway line, which you can take east to get into Center City and to hotels near the venue. The local transit organization is [SEPTA](http://septa.org/). You will need to buy a [refillable Key Card](http://www.septa.org/fares/pass/key.html) from kiosks at stations.

Coming from the airport, there is a commuter train that also gets you into Center City or cabs have flat rate fares into the neighborhoods where the venue and hotels are located.

The Fleisher Art Memorial is in a residential neighborhood, with lots of shops, restaurants, and activities just a few blocks away. It's a really pleasant walk from nearby neighborhoods, on a planned grid system to make it easier to navigate, with the venue between 7th and 8th Streets and just a few blocks south of South Street.

For accessing the venue, it is not on a subway line this year. The 47 bus will get you closest to the venue, which goes south down 8th street and north up 7th street, with a stop on the block of the venue. A few blocks north of the venue, you could take the 40 bus and get off at 8th and South Streets and walk four blocks south. There are additional bus routes and subway options approximately a 20-minute walk from the venue.

We are looking into other accessibility options. If you have any questions or would like more information about other ways to access the venue, [please let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org).

## Meals at SRCCON

We want you to be happy and well-fed at SRCCON:LEAD, so we’re providing breakfast and lunch on both days. We’ll have tea, coffee, and snacks—both healthy and sugary—throughout the day as well. And we'll gather in small groups for [Tuesday dinners](/dinner)! (Thanks for your recommendations on restaurant options, and please [let us know](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) if your organization might be interested in sponsoring a small group dinner).
