<p class="big-lead">Our <a href="/participation/form">call for participation form</a> is open through October 7. We&rsquo;re excited to hear about your session ideas!</p>

# The SRCCON:LEAD program

At SRCCON:LEAD, we'll come together as a community to figure out how we can reshape the ways journalism leadership operates. This is a brand-new event where we'll:

* inspire each other to transform our own organizations, regardless of title or job description
* teach each other the practical skills—from handling money and hiring to effective communication—we can use to be part of that change

## Schedule overview

SRCCON:LEAD takes place November 19 & 20 in Philadelphia, at the [Fleisher Art Memorial](https://fleisher.org/).

We'll release an official schedule as we get closer to the event, but you can count on conference days that start around 9am and close before 6pm. Most attendees will arive the day before SRCCON:LEAD begins and leave the day after, but we'll close our second day in time for evening flights for those who need them.

## About sessions at SRCCON:LEAD

SRCCON:LEAD is built around two days of talks, peer-led conversations, and hands-on workshops. The community members who step up to participate in and facilitate these sessions make it all possible. They bring their experience with a topic as well as the questions they haven't answered, and guide conversations and collaborative work that helps everyone head home with new ideas.

The sessions on our schedule are proposed and led by community members who want to lead conversations or develop new resources to share. Successful sessions often emerge from a single question or problem—if you’ve been struggling with just about any aspect of your work, you can bet others have dealt with it, too.

We'll also make space at SRCCON:LEAD for emergent conversations and small-group gatherings. If a great idea occurs to you on the way to Philly (or even in the middle of a session there!), we'll have room for it.

## How do collaborative sessions work?

There are a lot of ways to think about the SRCCON:LEAD program, but here's the most important thing to know: our sessions are highly collaborative. In peer-led sessions at SRCCON:LEAD, we'll discuss ways journalism leadership needs to change so we can build more representative, equitable newsrooms. And we'll teach each other the practical skills to transform our own organizations, regardless of title or job description. OpenNews staff are available to support facilitators in planning their sessions and in implementing next steps after the event, too.

We want to make this a [genuinely participatory event](/participation), and it's hard to be part of a conversation or work together in a session that's mostly lecture. So we look for sessions that include real interactivity, and we love creative formats that support learning. Outstanding sessions might include design exercises, art and games, small-group work, role playing, even field trips—and we're always interested in new ideas.

SRCCON:LEAD sessions last about 60-75 minutes, and we encourage facilitators to think about outlines and information density. Overprogramming a session with too many activities can make it hard to reach a satisfying goal—but a session that's underdesigned can easily turn into a conversation between a handful of the loudest people. We're happy to help facilitators figure out the right balance.
