Some problems are easy to foresee: swoop and poop managers, clashing personalities, untested assumptions, and decision makers without context or knowledge. Other problems are more insidious such as misunderstandings due to cultural differences or power inequities that silence people from marginalized communities. And we know what happens next: misalignment, lack of buy-in leading to mistrust, angst, failed projects, and teams being disempowered.\n\nHow do we make sure decisions result in alignment and clarity for everyone on the team? How do we make sure the communities we serve are heard in the decision-making? How do we change our minds as we learn new things? How do we create a safe space for equitable participation when there are cultural differences, power dynamics, or team members optimizing for different outcomes? \n\nJoin Tina and Cordelia as we take a stroll through an ecosystem of collective decision making methods and talk about how to apply them to make better products and nurture healthier communities.",

How many times have you been asked, months later, why a certain decision was made and had to give a vague answer on your \"feelings\" about the issue. Or how many times have you noticed a pattern of the same problematic decision being made over and over again but without any actual records to support your argument? \n\nDecision tracking is a crucial project management component. We know this as it relates to code projects. We try to instill a habit of version control, tracking changes, and writing reproducible, documented files. But when it comes to the day-to-day strategy decisions that drive the content and impact of our journalism, we don't take the same consistently documented approach. This scattered project management means that it is harder to support decisions, especially for women and people of color, it is harder to transfer institutional knowledge, it is harder to get large teams aligned, and it is harder to spot patterns that indicate problematic approaches. \n\nLet's explore what information about decisions in our organizations would be useful to record, how to track and share decisions within and across our teams, and how to get buy in for transparent decision making. \n\nInteractive portion idea: We will have some problems to solve as small groups, and then we will determine what context needs to be recorded. Then pairs of groups will ask questions and suggest alternatives and we will test the usefulness of the tracking. Did everyone feel their input was captured?
